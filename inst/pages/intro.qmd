This work - [**Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis with Bioconductor**](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/) [@OMA] -
contributes novel methods and educational resources for microbiome data science.
It aims to teach the grammar of Bioconductor workflows in the context of
microbiome data science. We show, through concrete examples, how to use
the latest developments and data analytical strategies in
R/Bioconductor for the manipulation, analysis, and reproducible
reporting of hierarchical, heterogeneous, and multi-modal microbiome
profiling data. The data science methodology is tightly integrated
with the broader R/Bioconductor ecosystem. The support for modularity and
interoperability is key to efficient resource sharing and
collaborative development both within and across research fields.

## Bioconductor {#sec-bioconductor}

Bioconductor is a project that focuses on the development of high-quality open
research software for life sciences [@Gentleman2004; @Huber2015]. The software
packages are primarily coded in R, and they undergo continuous testing and peer
review to ensure high quality.

Central to the software in Bioconductor are data containers, which provide a
structured presentation of data. A data container consists of slots that are
dedicated to certain type of data, for example, to abundance table and sample
metadata. Biological data is often complex and
multidimensional, making data containers particularly beneficial. There are
several key advantages to using data containers:

- **Ease of handling:** Data subsetting and bookkeeping become more straightforward.
- **Development efficiency:** Developers can create efficient methods,
knowing the data will be in a consistent format.
- **User accessibility:** Users can easily apply complex methods to their data.

The most common data container in Bioconductor is `SummarizedExperiment`.
It is further expanded to fulfill needs of certain application field.
`SummarizedExperiment` and its derivatives, have already
been widely adopted in microbiome research, single cell sequencing, and in other
fields, allowing rapid adoption and the extension of emerging data science
techniques across application domains. See [@sec-data-containers] for more details
on how to handle data containers from the `SummarizedExperiment` family.

The Bioconductor microbiome data science framework consists of:

- **Data containers**, designed to organize multi-assay microbiome data
- **R/Bioconductor packages** that provide dedicated methods
- **Community** of users and developers

## Microbiome data science in Bioconductor {#sec-microbiome-bioc}

The `phyloseq` data container has been dominant in the microbiome field within
Bioconductor over the past decade [@McMurdie2013]. However, there has been a
growing popularity of tools based on the `SummarizedExperiment` framework.

An optimal data container should efficiently store and manage large volumes of
data, including modified or transformed copies. Furthermore, it should
seamlessly integrate into the broader ecosystem of Bioconductor, minimizing
duplication of effort and facilitating interoperability with other tools and
packages.

`TreeSummarizedExperiment` was developed to address these requirements
[@Huang2021]. The miaverse framework was subsequently built around the
`TreeSummarizedExperiment` data container [@sec-ecosystem].

## Open data science {#sec-open-data}

Open data science emphasizes sharing code and, where feasible, data alongside
results [@Shetty2019]. Utilizing Bioconductor tools facilitates the development
of efficient and reproducible data science workflows. Enhanced transparency in
research accelerates scientific progress. As open science is a fundamental
concept in microbiome research, this book, particularly in [@sec-training]
aims to educate readers about reproducible reporting practices.
