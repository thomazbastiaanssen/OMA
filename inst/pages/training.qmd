## Checklist {#sec-checklist}

Brief checklist to prepare for training (see below for links).

- Install the recommended software
- If the time allows, watch the short online videos and familiarize yourself
with the other available material
- Join Gitter online chat for support

## Recommended software {#sec-software}

We recommend installing and setting up the relevant software packages on
your own computer as this will support later use. The essential
components to install include:

- [R (the latest official release)](https://www.r-project.org/)

- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/);
choose "Rstudio Desktop" to download the latest version. Check the
[Rstudio home page](https://www.rstudio.com/) for more
information. RStudio is optional.

- Install key R packages (Section [@sec-ecosystem] provides an
installation script)

- After a successful installation you can consider trying out examples
from Section [@sec-exercises] already before training. **You can run
the workflows by simply copy-pasting examples.** You can then test
further examples from this tutorial, modifying and applying these
techniques to your own data. Plain source code for the individual chapters
of this book are available via
[Github](https://github.com/microbiome/OMA/tree/master/R)

- If you have access to CSC notebook you can find instructions from
[here](https://microbiome.github.io/outreach/).
